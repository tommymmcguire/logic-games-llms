There are five men of different nationalities living in them: an Englishman, a German, an Italian, a Spaniard, and a Chinese. These men grow the following berries in their gardens: raspberries, currants, gooseberries, strawberries, or grapes. Each of them has a pet: a dog, a cat, a parrot, a hamster, or fish. Each of them likes a certain brand of chocolate: Twix, Snickers, Mars, Bounty, Kitkat. Conditions of Einstein's riddle: 1. An Englishman lives in the red house. 2. A German owns a dog. 3. A man living in the green house plants raspberries. 4. An Italian plants grapes in his garden. 5. The green house is next to the white one to the right. 6. A man who likes Twix owns a cat. 7.

There are five men of different nationalities living in them: an Englishman, a German, an Italian, a Spaniard, and a Chinese. These men grow the following berries in their gardens: raspberries, currants, gooseberries, strawberries, or grapes. Each of them has a pet: a dog, a cat, a parrot, a hamster, or fish. Each of them likes a certain brand of chocolate: Twix, Snickers, Mars, Bounty, Kitkat. Conditions of Einstein's riddle: 1. An Englishman lives in the red house. 2. A German owns a dog. 3. A man living in the green house plants raspberries. 4. An Italian plants grapes in his garden. 5. The green house is next to the white one to the right. 6. A man who likes Twix owns a cat. 7.

There are five houses of different colors on the site: a red one, a green one, a blue one, a yellow one and a white one. There are five men of different nationalities living in them: an Englishman, a German, an Italian, a Spaniard, and a Chinese. These men grow the following berries in their gardens: raspberries, currants, gooseberries, strawberries, or grapes. Each of them has a pet: a dog, a cat, a parrot, a hamster, or fish. Each of them likes a certain brand of chocolate: Twix, Snickers, Mars, Bounty, Kitkat. Conditions of Einstein's riddle: 1. An Englishman lives in the red house. 2. A German owns a dog. 3. A man living in the green house plants raspberries. 4. An Italian plants grapes in his garden. 5. The green house is next to the white one to the right. 6. A man who likes Twix owns a cat. 7.

There are five men of different nationalities living in them: an Englishman, a German, an Italian, a Spaniard, and a Chinese. These men grow the following berries in their gardens: raspberries, currants, gooseberries, strawberries, or grapes. Each of them has a pet: a dog, a cat, a parrot, a hamster, or fish. Each of them likes a certain brand of chocolate: Twix, Snickers, Mars, Bounty, Kitkat. Conditions of Einstein's riddle: 1. An Englishman lives in the red house. 2. A German owns a dog. 3. A man living in the green house plants raspberries. 4. An Italian plants grapes in his garden. 5. The green house is next to the white one to the right. 6. A man who likes Twix owns a cat. 7.

There are five men of different nationalities living in them: an Englishman, a German, an Italian, a Spaniard, and a Chinese. These men grow the following berries in their gardens: raspberries, currants, gooseberries, strawberries, or grapes. Each of them has a pet: a dog, a cat, a parrot, a hamster, or fish. Each of them likes a certain brand of chocolate: Twix, Snickers, Mars, Bounty, Kitkat. Conditions of Einstein's riddle: 1. An Englishman lives in the red house. 2. A German owns a dog. 3. A man living in the green house plants raspberries. 4. An Italian plants grapes in his garden. 5. The green house is next to the white one to the right. 6. A man who likes Twix owns a cat. 7.

There are five men of different nationalities living in them: an Englishman, a German, an Italian, a Spaniard, and a Chinese. These men grow the following berries in their gardens: raspberries, currants, gooseberries, strawberries, or grapes. Each of them has a pet: a dog, a cat, a parrot, a hamster, or fish. Each of them likes a certain brand of chocolate: Twix, Snickers, Mars, Bounty, Kitkat. Conditions of Einstein's riddle: 1. An Englishman lives in the red house. 2. A German owns a dog. 3. A man living in the green house plants raspberries. 4. An Italian plants grapes in his garden. 5. The green house is next to the white one to the right. 6. A man who likes Twix owns a cat. 7.

There are five houses of different colors on the site: a red one, a green one, a blue one, a yellow one and a white one. There are five men of different nationalities living in them: an Englishman, a German, an Italian, a Spaniard, and a Chinese. These men grow the following berries in their gardens: raspberries, currants, gooseberries, strawberries, or grapes. Each of them has a pet: a dog, a cat, a parrot, a hamster, or fish. Each of them likes a certain brand of chocolate: Twix, Snickers, Mars, Bounty, Kitkat. Conditions of Einstein's riddle: 1. An Englishman lives in the red house. 2. A German owns a dog. 3. A man living in the green house plants raspberries. 4. An Italian plants grapes in his garden. 5. The green house is next to the white one to the right. 6. A man who likes Twix owns a cat. 7.
